Quiz: Basic Blog
There are a few things I didn't cover in the lecture that will be helpful for this homework. Links to this material can be found here.

In order to be graded correctly for this homework, there are a few things to keep in mind. We'll be grading your web app by POSTing new blog entries to your form and checking that they appear on your blog's front page. There are a few main issues you need to keep in mind in order for this to work:

We assume your form to create new blog entries is at a path of '/newpost' from your blog's front page. That is, if your blog's front page is at 'www.myblog.com/blog', then the form is at 'www.myblog.com/blog/newpost'.
The form method must be POST, not GET.
The form input boxes must have the names 'subject' and 'content' in order for the grading script to correctly post to them.
You must enter the full url into the supplied textbox above, including the path to your blog's front page. For example, the fake example blog above is running at 'www.myblog.com/blog', but if we instead only entered 'www.myblog.com/' then the grading script would not work.
Don't forget to escape your output!

I realized while recording the solution to HW3, there are a few things that I didn't cover in the lecture that will be helpful to know. After submitting a blog post, I ask you to redirect to a permalink for that post.

The URL format might look something like this: /blog/1001, where 1001 is the ID of the post you just submitted.

To get the ID of an entity you just created: obj.key().id()

Find some examples of more complex URL handling here.

To look up an object by ID, you can use the get_by_id() function.

Hope this helps!
